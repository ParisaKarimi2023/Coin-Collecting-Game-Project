Coin Collecting Game
The Coin Collecting Game Project is a 2D interactive game designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts of game development,
including game logic, collision detection, scoring systems, and user interaction.
The game challenges players to control a character that collects coins while navigating obstacles within a virtual environment.
Developed using Python and game development libraries, this project highlights the practical application of programming, graphics, and event-driven systems in game design .
